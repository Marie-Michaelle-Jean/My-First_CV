  I am intensively learning the above listed computer languages. I am attending
  online courses, through “Code First Girl”(CFG). CFG is a learning platform
  dedicated only for women. The platform’s main aim is to empower women in
  technology and give them the unfair advantage. They work with a couple of
  partners to teach women to code for free. The classes end with a final project
  that you can complete alone or in a group.
